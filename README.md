# Rock-Paper-Scissors_Game
This code creates a simple graphical window using Tkinter, where the user can select their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) by clicking on the corresponding button. The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the winner is determined based on the game rules. The result is then displayed in a label at the bottom of the window.
